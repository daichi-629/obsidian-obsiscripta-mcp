# Release process

This repo uses the GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## Prerequisites

- You have push access to the repository.
- The working tree is clean.

## Steps

1. Bump the version from the repo root:
   - `pnpm run version:bump 1.0.1`
   - Or `pnpm run version:patch` / `version:minor` / `version:major`
2. Commit and push the change.
3. Run **Actions → Release Obsidian plugin** (workflow_dispatch).
4. The workflow creates a tag that matches `manifest.json` (no leading `v`) and a draft GitHub release with assets.
5. Review the draft release and publish it.

## Notes

- Release assets are generated by the workflow and include:
  - `packages/obsidian-plugin/main.js`
  - `packages/obsidian-plugin/manifest.json`
  - `packages/obsidian-plugin/styles.css` (if present)
  - `packages/stdio-bridge/dist/pkg/*`
